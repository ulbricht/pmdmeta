Mass wasting includes slow displacements, such as creep and solifluction, and rapid movements such as rockfalls, rockslides, and cohesive debris flows (Jackson, 1997, p. 392). Includes both subaerial mass-wasting processes and subaqueous mass-wasting processes."

http://epos/WP16Vocabulary/AnalogueMaterial/Paraffin,"Paraffin","It belongs to a class of hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2nþ2, generally known as alkanes or paraffins (sensu lato). Paraffin oil is a complex liquid mixture of saturated alkanes in the range of C10 to C18 (Freund et al., 1982) with a density of 0.8e 0.9 g/cm3. It is translucent and odourless. Pure paraffin oil is a liquid at room temperature (Park and Song, 2010). (see e.g. Duarte et al., 2014 for details)."
http://epos/WP16Vocabulary/AnalogueMaterial/Silicon,"Silicon/Silly putty/PDMS","Silicones, also known as polysiloxanes, are polymers that include any inert, synthetic compound made up of repeating units of siloxane, which is a chain of alternating silicon atoms and oxygen atoms, frequently combined with carbon and/or hydrogen. Some common forms include silicone oil, silicone grease, silicone rubber, silicone resin, and silicone caulk. (Wikipedia) Silicone polymers are generally mixed with various amounts of granular fillers or plasticine in order to vary the effective viscosity or the density of a material. (see e.g. Boutelier et al., 2008 for details)."
http://epos/WP16Vocabulary/AnalogueMaterial/Plasticine,"Plasticine","The organic matrix of plasticine consists of wax, Vaseline, oil and lubrication solvent. The fillers are generally inorganic (e.g. calcite, barite, kaolinite, fluorite and illite and small amounts of dyes such as titanium dioxide, magnetite or haematite) or organic (e.g. potato starch). The amount of filler volume ranges from 56% to 40%. Plasticine has been used to simulate geological structures such as folds, boudins, diapirs etc. (J. Zulauf and G. Zulauf, 2004)."
http://epos/WP16Vocabulary/AnalogueMaterial/Cement,"Cement-Plaster","The most common types of plaster mainly contain either gypsum, lime, or cement. The plaster is manufactured as a dry powder and is mixed with water to form a stiff but workable paste immediately before it is applied to the surface. The reaction with water liberates heat through crystallization and the hydrated plaster then hardens. Cement plaster is a mixture of suitable plaster, sand, portland cement and water. "
http://epos/WP16Vocabulary/AnalogueMaterial/Gelatine,"Gelatine","“Gelatine” is the ordinary name for particular biopolymers. The term is used for both plant and animal biopolymers. They are naturally occurring long-chain polymers either composed of amino acids (peptides, polypeptides, proteins) or of saccharides (mono-, oligo-, and polysaccharides). Such macromolecules, available in tasteless and odorless powder form, are water diluted in small quantities. (Di Giuseppe et al., 2009)"
http://epos/WP16Vocabulary/AnalogueMaterial/Gelatine/PigSkin,"Pig skin","Gelatine extracted from the skin of domesticated pigs."
http://epos/WP16Vocabulary/AnalogueMaterial/Gelatine/K-caragean,"K-caragean","Carrageenans or carrageenins are a family of linear sulfated polysaccharides that are extracted from red edible seaweeds. There are three main varieties of carrageenan, which differ in their degree of sulphation. Kappa-carrageenan has one sulphate group per disaccharide, Iota-carrageenan has two, and Lambda-carrageenan has three. Kappa forms strong, rigid gels in the presence of potassium ions; it reacts with dairy proteins. It is sourced mainly from Kappaphycus alvarezii. "
http://epos/WP16Vocabulary/AnalogueMaterial/Gelatine/GellanGum,"Gellan gum","Gellan gum is a water-soluble anionic polysaccharide produced by the bacterium Sphingomonas elodea (formerly Pseudomonas elodea)."
http://epos/WP16Vocabulary/AnalogueMaterial/Gelatine/Xantan,"Xantan","A polysaccharide. It is a powerful thickening agent, and also has uses as a stabilizer to prevent ingredients from separating. It can be produced from a range of simple sugars using a fermentation process, and derives its name from the strain of bacteria used in this: Xanthomonas campestris.("
http://epos/WP16Vocabulary/AnalogueMaterial/Natrosol,"Natrosol","Natrosol hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) is a series of off-white powders that are easily dispersed and dissolved in cold or hot water, to produce solutions of varying viscosities. Chemically, it is cellulose of short to very long chain length that has been etherified to a hydroxyethyl ether to achieve an optimum balance of properties. Natrosol is used as a viscosity and rheology modifier, protective colloid, water retention agent, stabilizer, and suspending agent, particularly in those applications where a nonionic material is desired. "
http://epos/WP16Vocabulary/AnalogueMaterial/Glycerine,"Glycerine","(or glycerol, glycerin) is a simple polyol compound. It is a colorless, odorless, viscous liquid. The glycerol backbone is found in all lipids known as triglycerides. Glycerol has three hydroxyl groups that are responsible for its solubility in water and its hygroscopic nature. Glycerol is generally obtained from plant and animal sources where it occurs as triglycerides (esters of glycerol with long-chain carboxylic acids). "

http://epos/WP16Vocabulary/AnalogueMaterial/FoamRubber,"Foam rubber","Foam rubber (also known as cellular, sponge, or expanded rubber) refers to rubber that has been manufactured with a foaming agent to create an air-filled matrix structure. Commercial foam rubbers are generally made of either polyurethane or natural latex."
http://epos/WP16Vocabulary/AnalogueMaterial/Polytungstate,"Polytungstate","Solid Sodium polytungstate (SPT)  exists as white crystals and aqueous SPT is a light yellow-green transparent solution. In powder form, SPT is a 12-fold aggregated isopolytungstate. Due to its very high solubility in water (max. density 3.1 g/cm3) SPT is widely used as a heavy liquid for gravity separation (sink swim analysis) and density gradient centrifugation. Aqueous SPT is non-toxic, non-flammable, odorless, reusable and additionally it has a low viscosity."
http://epos/WP16Vocabulary/AnalogueMaterial/BariumSulphate,"Barium sulphate","(or sulphate) is the inorganic compound with the chemical formula BaSO4. It is a white crystalline solid that is odorless and insoluble in water. It occurs as the mineral barite, which is the main commercial source of barium and materials prepared from it. It has white opaque appearance and high density. "
